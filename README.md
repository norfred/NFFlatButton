Custom flat button 'Ã  la Letterpress' written in Swift.

**`NFFlatButton` is a subclass of `UIButton`, so it works as a normal button!**

##How to use
1. Import `NFFlatButton.swift` to your project folder.
2. Initialize a `NFFlatButton` in `viewDidLoad()` method:
 ```swift
  override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        // Init a new NFFlatButton
        let flatButton: NFFlatButton = NFFlatButton(frame: CGRectMake(100.0, 128.0, 120.0, 36.0))
        
        // Set title and color
        flatButton.setTitle("Title", forState: .Normal)
        flatButton.setTitleColor(UIColor.blackColor(), forState: .Normal)
        
        // Add to view
        view.addSubview(flatButton)
    }
```
3. Done!
